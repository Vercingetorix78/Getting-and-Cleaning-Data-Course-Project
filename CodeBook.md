## Codebook
This document provides information about Tidy, the data set outputted by run_analysis.R. Note that tidy consists of a 180 observations (30 subjects each performing 6 different activities)  of 81 variables (Subject and Activity and 79 measurements). 

##### Variable Names
- Subject: the subject id; it takes values between 1 and 30 and identifies the subject who performed a specific activity.
- Activity: A factor variable with six levels: 1. Walking, 2. Walking Upstairs, 3. Walking Downstairs, 4. Sitting, 5. Standing, 6. Laying. 

The remaining 79 variables refer to measurements taken of a subject performing one of the six activities. The names are as they appear in the original UCI HAR data set, except that the dashes have been eliminated to improve readablity.
For completeness, here are the names of these variables:
